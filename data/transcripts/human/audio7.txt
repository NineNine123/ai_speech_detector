And I would say, okay, this is my time to clean the house, pristine, beautiful. So I did that for two weeks and they would come in 10 minutes later, like, you know, within 10 minutes after my finish cleaning, they come in and everything's just disarray. Things are everywhere again within 10 minutes. And I'm like, why am I bothering doing this?
