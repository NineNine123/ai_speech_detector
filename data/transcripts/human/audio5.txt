You've been in the room when this happens. Someone starts to talk in a board meeting and they begin and they go on and on and on. The board chair says thank you very much, Miss Jones or Mr. Jones, and tries to redirect them. They do for a second and all of a sudden, Miss Jones or Mr. Jones is back. Blah.
